# A Modular XML Editor
This project comes from an interesting project in my master study career. I used to share it in the old [repository](https://github.com/SunnySunMoon/XML-editor). 3 years past and this old repository received 10 starts. It seems like that it indeed has a little use. So I decide to make it a better modular editor.

## Not aim to build a rich-text editor
This mean that I will not invest time to make a truly editor. It's just a tool aimming to rig some xml components.
